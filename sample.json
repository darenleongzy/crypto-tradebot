        'selftext': 'It\'s a very exciting time for NFT\'s or "non-fungible tokens," allowing ownership of provably unique digital assets. There has been an absolute explosion in high-value NFT sales and auctions in recent months for NFT\'s representing original artistic works, virtual sports memorabilia, historic tweets, and more. NFT\'s also promise to revolutionize gaming by allowing the players in virtual worlds to obtain, own, trade, and in some cases even create, provably rare/unique items and assets that could correspond with real-world monetary value and even be made portable across multiple virtual worlds.\n\nSo far, the way most people have begun to understand the value of NFT\'s is via conceptual proxy—developing metaphors in relation what came before, like the metaphor of "digital cash" in the early days of Bitcoin, or more recently "digital gold" as its broadly understood use case has evolved more towards a store of value over the past several years. People see NFT\'s largely as the digitized form of rare collectibles and original artwork; "digital paintings," "digital sculptures," "digital baseball cards," and perhaps "digital first-edition books signed by their author."\n\nEven within the confines of this limited conceptualization, NFT\'s have driven a gold rush in the crypto investment space. Some expect that this will turn out to be a relatively short-lived speculative mania, while others view their multi-million dollar NFT purchases as investments per se which they fully expect to appreciate in value long into the future the same way an art collector expects an original painting by Goya or Van Gogh to appreciate in value. Skeptics rightly point out that the actual content of any given NFT can be viewed, copied, and distributed limitlessly; believers point out that paintings and other works of art are copied by the million all around the world every year, and the collector within them is content to know they own "the original" as proven by a digital token that only they possess. Speculative mania or not, this is only the tip of the iceberg for the impact that NFT\'s are bound to have on the world.\n\nOne nascent application of NFT\'s can be discerned by realizing that an individual *license* to "own," or in practice to possess, view, listen to, read, or otherwise engage with a discrete piece of digital content, can take the form of a *provably unique digital asset* just as easily, and perhaps more meaningfully, than an infinitely replicable piece of digital content itself can.\n\n**In the long term, NFT\'s could revolutionize digital rights management for all forms of art, entertainment, and media content, obsolescing centralized content distribution channels and eventually even much of traditional intellectual property law.**\n\nImagine every song, film, video, game, software, or other piece of discrete digital content that exists, all hosted in an encrypted state in massive, comprehensive, and easily accessible compendiums on open-source decentralized networks that govern access to specific pieces of content by seamlessly interfacing with a user\'s NFT wallet, which serves as a platform-agnostic immutable proof of "ownership" (or individual license) for every song, film, etc, that said user might purchase in a lifetime, allowing instant access for streaming on any compatible internet-enabled media device wherever they go, or enabling downloads to their PC or home server in full uncompressed quality for offline viewing—all without any need for traditional clunky and invasive DRM, getting stuck with one or more multiple competing "store" platforms with non-transferrable licenses, or having to pay for multiple ongoing subscription services in order to maintain access to the content you want.\n\nImagine the \'good old days\' of BitTorrent, but transmogrified in such a way that is indisputably win-win for both content creators and consumers, while undercutting the dinosaur media conglomerates currently serving as expensive middlemen who syphon value away on both sides by clinging to outdated and inefficient strategies for both distribution and profitmaking. Consumers get the ease of accessing anything they want at any time on any device, and although it\'s not \'*free*\' as in the case of the illegal file-sharing popular in BitTorrent\'s hayday, they only have to buy any piece of content once, period. (And at a lower than historical cost.) Content creators large and small benefit too, because everyone who is accessing their content in this way has provably paid to \'own their own copy of it,\' plus they no longer have all the overhead (distribution, hosting, licensing, billing, etc) that they are currently forced farm out to large corporations in exchange for 90%+ of the value they create for consumers. They simply get to focus on the creative process and creating value for consumers, perhaps giving up a mere 5-10% to some firm or specialist to help structure and market their NFT releases. No worries about files being altered and reuploaded by malicious actors either, because the NFT\'s can incorporate a checksum that verifies that the file being downloaded or accessed for streaming is an exact copy of the authorized piece of content originally released by the creator before allowing execution.\n\nRather than individuals needing to anonymously or pseudonymously "seed" individual files and pieces of content to keep them alive on the network at their own expense, in exchange for nothing but \'likes\' and risking piracy prosecution in the process, literally anyone in the world can be compensated at the margin for hosting every piece of encrypted, NFT-verified content in existence that they might care to keep a copy of on an internet-connected local drive, similar to how users of Filecoin or Storj or Sia currently elect to make some portion of their local drive(s) available for decentralized cloud storage in exchange for token rewards—only on networks structured by incentives that improve both distribution efficiency and content diversity by dynamically rewarding the hosting of high-demand content in specific areas and the hosting of rare or obscure content based on its relative lack of availability on the network, etc. And they can do this without risk of legal prosecution because they encrypted files are useless in the absence of a matching NFT-based license "key" in the possession of any given recipient to unlock them.\n\nWhile straightforward piracy would remain technically possible (any one person who buys an NFT license to decrypt the official release of a popular film, say, can screen-capture the content and reupload or share it elsewhere), lowered costs and improved ease of access for consumers makes purchasing NFT based licenses for content a competitive option relative to piracy, which most often requires some modicum of technical know-how that will be prohibitive to the general public, and carries legal risks nonetheless. When it\'s easier and less costly to do "the right thing," more people will, and most consumers do derive some sense of pride or virtue in paying a reasonable sum to support the musicians, film makers, artists, game developers, authors, and creators of the content they enjoy; we have seen proof of this in the general downtrend of music, film, and television piracy that has accompanied the rise of affordable music and video streaming services, as well as the decline in PC videogame piracy that followed the rise of Valve Corporation\'s STEAM gaming platform, which sought to compete directly with pirates by offering a permanent game library that users could take with them to any compatible machine, low sale prices, and a number of other value-added features. \n\nFor those familiar with the STEAM platform, it is in some sense actually a good mental model for imagining part of what is possible in using NFT\'s for decentralized digital rights management, because it is essentially a "wallet" of unique digital assets (individual, non-fungible lifetime content licenses) that can follow a user wherever they go and is largely machine-agnostic. STEAM, however, is obviously centralized platform, whereas decentralized digital rights management using NFT\'s could take shape in a combination of any number of open-source decentralized networks hosting encrypted files and media meant to be retrieved and unlocked on demand by their respective NFT license holders, and any number of platform-agnostic software or hardware wallets conforming to the same open-source standards and offering the same core functionality of storing a user\'s whole lifetime accumulation of NFT-based content licenses in one place. (Picture a STEAM game library, but rather than just all of your PC games in one place: it\'s all of your PC games, every song you\'ve ever purchased, every movie you\'ve ever purchased, every television show you\'ve ever purchased, every ebook you\'ve ever purchased, every audiobook you\'ve ever purchased, every piece of software you\'ve ever purchased, every lifetime or term membership you\'ve ever purchased to a website or online service—maybe even every membership to brick and mortar business chains you\'ve purchased, and every loyalty program status or non-transferrable points/miles/rewards balance you\'ve accumulated—and certainly every unique virtual item in every virtual game world you\'ve ever obtained—*all in one place*, that seamlessly interfaces with any compatible network or platform or portal on any applicable internet-connected device or point of service where you\'d ever want to access, stream, download, use, or dispose of any of those assets.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nContent creators could issue a variety of NFT-based licenses for different forms of their content in a variety of different ways appealing to a variety of different audiences and consumers, utilizing a variety of different strategies for market penetration and serving various levels of scarcity/collectability ranging from mere lifetime \'ownership\' to extreme exclusivity. \n\nFor instance, an established musical act or artist could issue a limited run of a certain number of special NFT licenses for their album\'s "collector\'s edition," say 10,000 or 100,000, that sell at a higher price but include a \'B-side\' that won\'t be included in the album\'s general release (which is also an NFT-based release, but without a limit on how many NFT\'s will be minted, instead simply minting them on demand whenever a purchase is made)—allowing true aficionados of the band or artist to be able to play those rare hidden B-side gems for friends and family who may otherwise never have been able to hear them, recapturing for the digital age some of the same charm once savored by collectors of rare vinyl records. Beyond a "collector\'s edition," an act could even do an auction for another 10 or 100 NFT\'s of the collector\'s edition album that include a personalized audio dedication recorded by the band/artist that is specific to the buyer\'s name. \n\nOn the flipside, an unknown act hoping to break out and placing more focus on audience growth than album sales could do a \'timed freemium\' NFT album release, where everyone who downloads the album up until a certain date gets to do so for free and is granted a badged NFT that grants the same lifetime ownership as the general paid album release to follow a few weeks or months later, incentivizing listeners of that genre to give this new music a try when they otherwise may not have, because A) they know they\'ll get to own the album for free forever if they *do* like the band, and B) they\'ll own an NFT for the album that\'s badged to indicate that they *"liked the band before it was cool."* \n\nMusical acts large or small could issue industry-targeted NFT licenses of their albums or singles for limited or unlimited radio, broadcast, or commercial use of varying types, intended to capture the approximate lifetime value they expect to be generated in mass-market broadcast usage in a one-time cost, or issue NFT licenses to commercial and broadcast entities that integrate smart contracts written to kick back some portion of the broadcasting entity\'s advertising revenue to the creator(s) commensurate with the number of views/listens or value otherwise added by playing their music during a broadcast. If a popular artist wanted to have their music licensed for use in film, TV, or commercials, but not to such a degree that it would \'cheapen\' the song, they could issue a limited number of commercial NFT licenses for that purpose and auction them off to the highest-paying film makers, studios, producers, etc, or offer discounted NFT\'s of the same license category to particular film makers and producers whose artistic or professional gravitas they personally trust, rather than signing all of those decisions and rewards over to a larger company that would dictate those kinds of licensing moves. \n\nApply the logic above for musicians to the production and distribution of film and television, videogames and videogame assets, software, et al, and you can see that the possibilities are virtually endless for the emergence of a new thriving and dynamic global artistic market ecosystem where costs and incentives are far more aligned for consumers and creators alike, enabling massive value creation with a far more equitable distribution of both profits and access to content, and massively lowering barriers to entry for would-be content creators everywhere. \n\nDecentralized digital rights management via NFT\'s will be a great leap forward in ushering in the [Imagination Age.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imagination_age)',
